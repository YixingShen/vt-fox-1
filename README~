This is the code tree and supporting documents for Virginia Tech's camera
experiment boards that will fly on AMSAT's FOX-1 satellite.

The goals of this system are to fly a 640x480 camera and:
1) Upon (UART) command, capture an image from the camera and convert to jpeg
2) Upon command, relay the jpeg image data over UART to the IHU (internal
housekeeping unit)


Folder descriptions:

datasheets/

-Contains datasheets of the modules used in both prototyping and the board
specification

pin_descriptions/

-Contains a spreadsheet which maps out the pins of the final board and provides
a reference for the pin alternate function register configuration bits

jpegant/

-This is the jpeg compression library that we're using.  A stripped-down CLI
version is located in: jpegantt/jpegant-stripped/src/encoder
-The stripped-down CLI version uses a file containing raw RGB values for a
640x480 picture to convert to jpeg

stm32f4-devel/

-Contains the ChibiOS/RT source tree to work with the stm32f4-discovery board

stm32l1-devel/

-Will contain the ChibiOS/RT source tree to work with the stm32l1-discovery
board

ChibiOS_doc/

-Documentation for ChibiOS/RT
