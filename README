This is the code tree and supporting documents for Virginia Tech's camera
experiment boards that will fly on AMSAT's FOX-1 satellite.

The goals of this system are to fly a 640x480 camera and:
1) Upon (UART) command, capture an image from the camera and convert to jpeg
2) Upon command, relay the jpeg image data over UART to the IHU (internal
housekeeping unit)


Folder descriptions:

IHU_Simulator/

- This contains x86 code to interface with a prototype Exp4 board.  It emulates the IHU per the specified ICD.  The simulator will also demonstrate how a jpeg image is re-assembled.

STM32L1_Code/

- The ARM Cortex-M3 code tree that runs on Exp4.  It contains ChibiOS/RT plus additional code to support the experiment
