== Steps for programming the stm32f4-discovery board ==

1) start st-util 
2) arm-none-eabi-gdb ch.elf 
3) target extended-remote :4242 
4) load 
5) run        


== Steps for communicating with the stm32f4-discorvery board via the bus pirate and gtkterm ==

# Make sure the bus pirate grey and black lines are connected to PB10 and PB11 (defined in main)  as well as GND
http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Common_Bus_Pirate_cable_pinouts

PB11 - Grey (TX)
PB10 - Black (RX)

1) start gtkterm
2) m        - select mode
3) 3        - UART
4) 19200    - baud rate of stm32f4 (set in halconf.h)
5) 1        - defualt (4 times)
6) (1)      - set transparent bridge
